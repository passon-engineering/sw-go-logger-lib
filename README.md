# Logger Package
The `logger` package provides a logging utility that allows you to log messages with different structuring. It includes features for structured logging.
## Usage

1. In your project, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Go project.

2. Use the `go get` command followed by the import path to download the package and its dependencies. For example, if the import path is `github.com/passon-engineering/sw-go-logger-lib`, run the following command:
   ```
   go get github.com/passon-engineering/sw-go-logger-lib
   ```

3. After running `go get`, Go will download the package and its dependencies and store them in your local Go workspace.

4. In your Go code, you can import the package using the import path you identified earlier. For example:
   ```go
   import "github.com/passon-engineering/sw-go-logger-lib/logger"
   ```

5. You can now use the functions, types, and other elements provided by the external package in your own code.

### Creating a Logger
To create a new logger instance, use the `NewLogger` function:

```go
	appLogger, err := logger.NewLogger(
		[]logger.LogFormat{
				logger.FORMAT_TIMESTAMP, 
				logger.FORMAT_STATUS, 
				logger.FORMAT_PRE_TEXT, 
				logger.FORMAT_HTTP_REQUEST, 
				logger.FORMAT_ID, 
				logger.FORMAT_SOURCE, 
				logger.FORMAT_DATA, 
				logger.FORMAT_ERROR, 
				logger.FORMAT_PROCESSING_TIME,
		}, logger.Options {
				OutputToStdout: false,
				OutputToFile: true,
				OutputFolderPath: "/path/to/log/folder/",
		}, logger.Container{
				Status: logger.STATUS_INFO,
				Info: "System Logger succesfully started! Awaiting logger tasks...",
	})
```

NOTE: The order you choose with `LogFormat` will be strictly kept!

When choosing a name, make sure it is unique and does not conflict with existing libraries or packages; so do not call your new instance `logger`.

You can decide in the options whether the logger information should be printed to STDOUT `OutputToStdout: true` and also to the file `OutputToFile: true`. By standard both option items are `false` if you do not specify it explicitely. 

* You can create one or more (be sure to choose different log files then) logger objects in your project and pass it's reference to your modules. 

### Logging Messages
To log a message, use the `Entry` method of the logger instance:

```go
// Start a time counter from here
startTime := time.Now()

// DO HERE SOME OPERATIONS - USER CODE HERE

// Define and prepare the logger container based on your operations result 
// It is also allowed that a field is left blank or not be considered
// Create a log entry container
container := logger.Container{
    Status:         logger.STATUS_INFO,
    PreText:        "SERVER1",
    HttpRequest:    r,
    Id:             "5f322ac4ba",
    Source:         "handler/user",
    Data:           "233",	
    Error:          "something went wrong",
    ProcessingTime: time.Since(startTime), // Takes elapsed time since start Time
}

// Necessary to finally write log
appLogger.Entry(container)
```

Another example:

```go
// Start a time counter from here
startTime := time.Now()

// DO HERE SOME OPERATIONS - USER CODE HERE

// Define and prepare the logger container based on your operations result 
// It is also allowed that a field is left blank or not be considered
container := logger.Container{
    Status:         logger.STATUS_INFO,
    Id:             "fafeeb13",
    Source:         "/handler/users",
    ProcessingTime: time.Since(startTime), // Takes elapsed time since start Time
    HttpRequest:    r,
}

// Necessary to finally write log
appLogger.Entry(container)
```

The `Container` struct contains the necessary information for the log entry.

The log message will be printed according to defined structure.

### Log Output
The log output will be printed to the standard output, file or both.
